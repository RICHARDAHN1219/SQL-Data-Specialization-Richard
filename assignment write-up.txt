Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 id
ii. Hours = 1562 business_id
iii. Category = 2643 business_id
iv. Attribute = 1115 business_id
v. Review = 10000 distinct id's, 8090 business_id's, 9581 user_id's
vi. Checkin = 493 distinct business_id
vii. Photo = 6493 distinct business_id, 10000 id
viii. Tip = 537 distinct user_id, 3979 business_id
ix. User = 10000 id
x. Friend = 11 distinct user_id
xi. Elite_years = 2780 distinct user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT COUNT(* ) 
	FROM user
	WHERE id is NULL
		OR name is NULL
		OR review_count IS NULL
		OR yelping_since IS NULL
		OR useful IS NULL 
		OR funny IS NULL 
		OR cool IS NULL 
		OR fans IS NULL 
		OR average_stars IS NULL 
		OR compliment_hot IS NULL 
		OR compliment_more IS NULL 
		OR compliment_profile IS NULL 
		OR compliment_cute IS NULL

		OR compliment_note IS NULL 
		OR compliment_plain IS NULL 
		OR compliment_cool IS NULL 
		OR compliment_funny IS NULL 
		OR compliment_writer IS NULL 
		OR compliment_photos IS NULL
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:5		avg:3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:1.0		max:5.0		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:0		max:2		avg:0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:1		max:53		avg:1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Posting more reviews does not correlate with more fans. If there was a correlation, we'd either see that there would be a decrease or increase in the decrease of fans, but the change in review_count is independent of the change in fans

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes. The hours spent at 4-5 star restaurants in Las Vegas either started earlier or had less hours if starting at the same time

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes. There were more reviews for the 4-5 star restaurants         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
These locations had different very different zipcodes so I can not make any inferences as to the location data

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT bus.name 
	,cat.category
	,bus.city
	, bus.postal_code
	,hours , 
CASE
	WHEN stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 
        THEN '2-3 stars'
	WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 
        THEN '4-5 stars'
	END AS rating,
		bus.review_count
FROM business bus
INNER JOIN hours h ON bus.id = h.business_id
INNER JOIN category cat ON cat.business_id = bus.id
WHERE city = 'Las Vegas' 
	AND category = 'Restaurants' 
	AND (rating = '2-3 stars' OR rating = '4-5 stars')
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY stars DESC

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
There was almost an average of 9 more reviews for the businesses that are open than closed
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
There is a higher average rating for these restaurants by approximately .16 stars         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT AVG(stars) as average_stars
    , AVG(review_count) as average_reviews
	, is_open
FROM business
GROUP By is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   I decided to predict the overall star rating for a business based on the hours, reviews, location, and type of business
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
   This  data helps businesses observe how other businesses in similar categories have higher or lower ratings showing them what they should do. For the data, I will need to have the review table and the business table essentially in order to grab not only the places that the businesses are in but also the actual reviews towards the businesses and the stars. Having something on the categories and hours would be helpful in finding patterns or correlations as to how businesses can receive more stars                      
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
